        <h3>Summary</h3>
        Growing up I was always fascinated with how computers and electronics in general worked. I was working retail during the 2020 Covid pandemic while trying to pursue a career in law enforcement. After a year of dealing with all the craziness in the country I decided it was time for a career change. I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp so I could learn about what makes everything on the internet possible. I hope that I am able to expand on what I have learned so I can help create something for people to enjoy.
